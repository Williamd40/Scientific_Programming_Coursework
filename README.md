    How to run this project
</h2>

<h3>
    Setting up
</h3>

<p1>
    To run this code, simply set your working directory to '~\Scientific_Programming_Coursework\Scripts'. <br>
    Next, using Ubuntu, turn your terminal to one which can interpret BASH scripts, this is often done by simply typing BASH into the cmd terminal itself.
    You will then see green and blue text, in place of the white text. You may be missing some of the required packages, to install them simply follow the on screen sudo commands, as BASH will tell you the prompts to install these.

<h3>
Running the simulation
</h3>
<p2>
    This project is designed to be as user-friendly as possible, and as such
    a single BASH command will not only run both simulations together, but will also carry out all the data analysis. The outputted files will then be time stamped and stored in a specific output folder. You will get one output directory per full run through, containing one sub-directory per simulation. Each of these sub-directories will then contain four output folders. The output folders are as follows:
<dl>
    <dt>F1`</dt>
    <dd>EWRR</dd>

    <dt>F2</dt>
    <dd>F1222</dd>

    <dt>F333</dt>
    <dd> DDSF</dd>

</dl>
